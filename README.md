## üè≠ Industry Day
Celebrated on May 25, Industry Day highlights the importance of the industrial sector for Brazil's economic and social development. At SENAI, the date is marked by public events that present professional areas such as electricity, mechanics and technology. The event is especially aimed at students and alumni, who will have the opportunity to get to know the SENAI environment.

## üîê TecnoSeguran√ßa
The TecnoSeguran√ßa app was developed around the theme "Challenges and Solutions of Brazilian Industry: Innovation, Automation, and Artificial Intelligence." It integrates innovative technologies to offer practical and modern solutions, including:
  
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Use of the Gemini API for advanced data processing.
- **Dashboards (BI):** Data visualization through interactive dashboards.
- **Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR):**  Immersive experiences for industrial training and simulations.

### üß© Development Stages
The project development was divided into four teams, each responsible for a specific stage:

1. **Figma Team:** Created the app's interface design and prototypes.
2. **Presentation Model Team:** Developed visual materials to showcase the project.
3. **Artificial Intelligence Team:** Integrated and implemented the Gemini API.
4. **Analytics Team:** Built indicator dashboards with a focus on Business Intelligence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** Ionic, React, Chart.js
- **Other Tools:** Gemini API

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
The TecnoSeguran√ßa project, developed with Ionic and React, generates several files. To keep everything organized, the structure was divided as follows:

### üìÅ Folders
- `/android`: Folder generated by Capacitor, containing files specific to the Android project.
- `/ios`: Folder generated by Capacitor, containing files specific to the iOS project.
- `/resources`: Stores app icons and optionally the splash screen.
- `/src`: The heart of the project, where the root file `index.html`, the style file `global.scss`, and the subfolders `app`, `assets`, and `environments` (where the API is configured) are located.
- `/dist`: Folder that automatically receives compiled data when syncing or copying from the browser to the Android project. No manual changes are required.
- `/icons`: Folder containing app icon files in various sizes.

### üìÑ Files
- `capacitor.config.ts`: File where the app name and other configurations are defined to generate the Android and iOS projects.
- `cypress.config.ts`: Currently requires no changes but can be used for future improvements in the project.
- `tsconfig.json`: Similar to `cypress.config.ts`, it doesn't need changes except in specific or urgent cases.
- `.env`: Stores environment variables such as API keys and configuration secrets.
- `vite.config.ts`: Configuration file for Vite, responsible for project build settings, plugins, and server behavior.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Project Development
If you want to work on TecnoSeguran√ßa development, follow the instructions below to set up and run the environment locally.

1. Download the project from GitHub
2. Open in Visual Studio Code with the project folder already installed
3. **Start the local server:** In Visual Studio Code, open the terminal (shortcut Ctrl + Shift + P, type "Terminal" and select "New Terminal" or click "Terminal" in the top menu) and run the command below to view the project in the browser:
   ```bash
   ionic serve
   ```
4. **Troubleshooting (optional):** If the project doesn't work, install the necessary dependencies with the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install @google/generative-ai
   npm install @capacitor/assets --save-dev
   npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2
   npm install framer-motion
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

### ü§ñ Android
If you want to work on web development and generate the app only for **Android**, follow the steps below:

1. **Sync the data:** To copy the web project files to the `android` folder use:
   ```bash
   ionic capacitor copy android
   ```
2. **Compile the project:** To generate a new Android build (or recreate the `android` folder from scratch), run:
   ```bash
   ionic capacitor build android
   ```
3. **Generate icons and splash screens (Optional):** Place the icon files (recommended: 1024x1024px) and splash screen (recommended: 2732x2732px) in the `resources` folder. Then run the following command after the previous `build`:
   ```bash
   npx capacitor-assets generate
   ```
4. **Open in Android Studio:** After the **build**, **Android Studio** will open automatically, and a prompt to start the app created by **Capacitor** may appear in the bottom right corner.
5. **Generate the APK:** In **Android Studio**, click on the top menu **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**. After the build, click **Locate** to find the `app-debug.apk` file in the output folder.
6. **Install on the device:** Connect an **Android** device to the computer via USB, transfer the `app-debug.apk` file to the device and install it. Make sure the "Install from unknown sources" option is enabled in the device settings.
> üí° **Tip:** For the best experience, ensure that all tools (Android Studio, Node.js, Ionic CLI, and VSC) are installed and configured correctly before starting.

### üçè iOS
If you want to work on web development and generate the app only for **iOS**, follow the steps below:

1. **Sync the data:** To copy the web project files to the `ios` folder use:
   ```bash
   ionic capacitor copy ios
   ```
2. **Compile the project:** To generate a new iOS build (or recreate the `ios` folder from scratch), run:
   ```bash
   ionic capacitor build ios
   ```
3. **Generate icons and splash screens (Optional):** Place the icon files (recommended: 1024x1024px) and splash screen (recommended: 2732x2732px) in the `resources` folder. Then run the following command after the previous `build`:
   ```bash
   npx capacitor-assets generate
   ```
4. **Open in Xcode:** After the **build**, **Xcode** will open automatically. Make sure you are signed into an **Apple Developer Program** account in **Xcode** settings to generate the `.ipa` file.
5. **Generate the .ipa file:** In **Xcode**, click **Product > Archive** in the top menu. This will create a **build** file for the app. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign the app with a valid certificate.
6. **Export the file:** After archiving, the "**Organizer**" window will open automatically. Select the generated file, click **Distribute App**, choose the desired option (like "**Ad Hoc**" for device testing), and export the `.ipa` file.
7. **Install on the device:** Connect an **iOS** device to the Mac via USB. Use **Xcode** or tools like **Apple Configurator** to transfer and install the `.ipa` file on the device.
   > **Note:** The "Install from unknown sources" option is not required on iOS, but the device must be registered to the Apple Developer account associated with the certificate used in the **build**.
> üí° **Tip**: Ensure all tools (Xcode, CocoaPods, Node.js, Ionic CLI, VSC) are correctly set up. Install CocoaPods with:  
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
